    "  I am Ryan Ancheta and this is a spam classifier model that I made. I used a Naive Bayes model with TF-IDF vectorization algorithm to train the machine learning model using a dataset of spam and ham emails from Kaggle. I used 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing and in the other file I will show you how to use the model with a python application that will take a text input from user and will classify it as spam or ham.\n",
